I understand that is can be quite intimidating! I got into coding making small games. Over time I got into modifying network servers in c#, c++, and Java. Now I do full stack web development using javascript, PHP, coldfusion. You might notice that is a lot of languages to be messing with! Once you learn one langauge you can learn other ones very quickly. I would push you to just start with Javascript and web tech. My favorite starting place is w3schools.com.
