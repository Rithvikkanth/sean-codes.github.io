That is alright! That happens to everyone. It’s hard to grasp code because it’s actually a different way of thinking. It’s actually much more simple! But that makes it weird. What I would do is try codeacademy course or two so you can get the basics. Write down these: Variables, Operators, Conditions, Loops, and Input/Output. With those few things you can basically do just about anything with code. If you find out exactly how each of those work you will be able to understand code a bit better!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="gamedev" /><category term="learn" /><category term="basics" /><category term="unity" /><summary type="html">Okay!
